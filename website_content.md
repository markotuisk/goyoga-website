## 3. FAQ Page

**SEO Title:** FAQ | Frequently Asked Questions | GoYoga Tallinn
**SEO Description:** Find answers to common questions about practicing Ashtanga yoga at GoYoga Tallinn. New students, pricing, etiquette, and more.

### Content (Grouped by Category)

**Category: 1. For Beginners**
- **Q:** I am not flexible at all, can I still join?
- **A:** Absolutely. Flexibility is a result of yoga, not a prerequisite. You do not need to be able to touch your toes when you come to class – we do the exercises so that the body becomes more mobile over time.
- **Q:** Which style is most suitable for a beginner?
- **A:** If you want a calm and relaxing class, we recommend Yin yoga or Hatha yoga. If you are looking for more physical exertion, Vinyasa (Flow) is suitable, but we recommend starting with a 'Beginner's Course' or a slower class.
- **Q:** I am elderly or overweight – can I manage?
- **A:** Yoga is meant for every body. The teacher always knows how to offer simpler variations (modifications) for the poses. Listen to your body and take breaks if you need them.
- **Q:** Can men come too?
- **A:** Yes, of course! Yoga is not just for women. Men of all ages attend our classes to improve mobility, relieve stress, and strengthen core muscles.

**Category: 2. Preparation & Equipment**
- **Q:** What should I wear for class?
- **A:** Put on comfortable sportswear that allows you to move freely (leggings/trousers and a T-shirt). No shoes are needed – we are barefoot in the hall (you can slip in socks, so we recommend taking them off while on the mat).
- **Q:** Do I need to bring my own mat?
- **A:** The studio has mats available and their use is included in the price. However, for hygienic reasons, it is recommended that regular practitioners purchase a personal mat.
- **Q:** Can I eat before class?
- **A:** We recommend avoiding large meals 2 to 3 hours before class. Doing exercises on a full stomach is uncomfortable and sometimes nauseating. A light snack (e.g., a banana or nuts) half an hour before class is allowed.

**Category: 3. Health & Special Situations**
- **Q:** Can I do yoga while pregnant?
- **A:** Please consult a doctor first. If you have done yoga before, you can often continue with special variations, but we strongly recommend joining a special pregnancy yoga class (especially from the second trimester).
- **Q:** Is yoga allowed during menstruation?
- **A:** Yes, but listen to your body. Avoid 'legs-up' (inversions) positions and very intense abdominal work. Yin yoga is often very supportive during this time.
- **Q:** I have back pain or an old injury. Can I participate?
- **A:** Inform the teacher about your injury before the start of the class. Mostly yoga is good for the back (especially 'Back Yoga' classes), but in the case of certain injuries, specific movements must be avoided.

**Category: 4. Logistics & Etiquette**
- **Q:** How much earlier should I arrive?
- **A:** Please arrive 10 to 15 minutes before the start of the class. Then you have time to calmly change clothes and settle in. Latecomers are not allowed into the hall so as not to disturb the concentration of others.
- **Q:** Do I need to book a spot in advance?
- **A:** Yes, the number of places in the hall is limited. Please register through the website's booking system (e.g., Hopitude).
- **Q:** Can I take my phone into the hall?
- **A:** The yoga hall is a screen-free zone. Please leave your phone in the changing room or turn it off completely (not to 'vibrate'). We also recommend putting smartwatches in 'Do not disturb' mode.
- **Q:** How can I pay? Can I pay with Stebby?
- **A:** You can pay on the spot with a card or in cash. Stebby: Yes, you can pay with a Stebby ticket. Please buy a ticket in the Stebby environment before the class and show the ticket code to the administrator.

**Category: Ashtanga & Global Yoga**
- **Q:** What is Ashtanga Yoga?
- **A:** Ashtanga Yoga is a traditional system of yoga that synchronizes breath with a progressive series of postures. This process produces intense internal heat and a profuse, purifying sweat that detoxifies muscles and organs. The result is improved circulation, a light and strong body, and a calm mind.
- **Q:** Who are the most famous Ashtanga Yoga teachers and gurus?
- **A:** The most prominent figure is Sri K. Pattabhi Jois, who founded the modern Ashtanga Vinyasa system. Renowned global teachers include Lino Miele, Sharath Jois, and Richard Freeman. In Estonia, Ricardo Martinez (a student of Lino Miele) is a key figure leading traditional retreats at GoYoga.
- **Q:** What is the difference between Ashtanga and Vinyasa Yoga?
- **A:** Ashtanga follows a fixed sequence of postures in the same order every time, emphasizing internal heat and discipline. Vinyasa is more creative and fluid; teachers create new flows for every class. Ashtanga is like a structured path, while Vinyasa is a creative journey.
- **Q:** Which celebrities practice Ashtanga Yoga?
- **A:** Many public figures credit Ashtanga for their fitness and mental clarity, including Sting, Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Robert Downey Jr. Sting often mentions how the practice keeps his body feeling youthful even after decades of performing.
